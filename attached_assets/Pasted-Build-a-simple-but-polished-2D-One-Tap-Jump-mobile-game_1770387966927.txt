Build a simple but polished 2D One Tap Jump mobile game using Unity (2D) and C# for Android.

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Game should be minimal and clean
- Background color: soft gradient sky (light blue to white)
- Player: simple solid color circle (or square), bright color like yellow or orange
- Platforms: flat rectangular bars, dark gray or green color
- Platforms move horizontally (left to right, right to left)
- Smooth animations, no heavy graphics
- Portrait mode only (mobile-first)
- UI text should be large and readable

GAMEPLAY & WORKING LOGIC:
- Player has Rigidbody2D with gravity
- On screen tap or mouse click:
  - Player jumps upward with a fixed force
  - Only one jump per landing (no double jump)
- Platforms continuously move horizontally
- Player must land on platforms to survive
- If player misses platform and falls below screen → Game Over
- Each successful landing increases score by +1
- Difficulty increases gradually:
  - After every 10 points, platform speed increases slightly
  - Gap between platforms becomes slightly larger
- High score must be saved using PlayerPrefs

GAME SCREENS:
1) Main Menu
   - Play button
   - Sound ON/OFF toggle
   - Banner Ad placeholder at bottom

2) Gameplay Screen
   - Score displayed at top center
   - No banner ads during gameplay (policy safe)

3) Game Over Screen
   - Final Score
   - High Score
   - Buttons:
     - Restart
     - Continue (watch ad)
   - Banner Ad placeholder at bottom

ADVERTISEMENT LOGIC (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Prepare AdMob-ready placeholder code (do NOT use real IDs)
- Interstitial Ad:
  - Show only after every 2nd game over (not every time)
  - Never show during gameplay
- Rewarded Ad:
  - Linked to "Continue" button on Game Over screen
  - On ad success:
    - Revive player on last platform
    - Only allow revive once per game
- Banner Ads:
  - Only on Main Menu and Game Over screen
- Add clear placeholder methods:
  - ShowBannerAd()
  - HideBannerAd()
  - ShowInterstitialAd()
  - ShowRewardedAd()
- Add comments explaining where real AdMob SDK code should be inserted

CODE STRUCTURE:
- PlayerController.cs (jump, collision, fall detection)
- PlatformController.cs (movement, respawn)
- GameManager.cs (score, difficulty, game states)
- UIManager.cs (menu, game over, buttons)
- AdManager.cs (all ad-related placeholder logic)

CODE QUALITY:
- Beginner-friendly C# scripts
- Clean, well-commented code
- Easy to extend later with sounds, skins, real ads

TARGET:
- Android mobile game
- Simple, playable, monetization-ready prototype
