Fix and optimize this app/game to work strictly in MOBILE PORTRAIT MODE with a mobile-first layout.

LAYOUT & ORIENTATION (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Lock the app to portrait mode only (no landscape support)
- Design UI for mobile screens only (360x640 and above)
- Use safe-area padding so UI does not touch screen edges
- All content must fit without horizontal scrolling
- Center-align main content vertically and horizontally

UI & BUTTON SAFETY:
- All buttons (Play, Restart, Continue, Menu) must be placed ABOVE ad areas
- No button should be overlapped or blocked by ads
- Add sufficient bottom margin (at least 80–100px) above banner ads
- Buttons should remain fully clickable on all screen sizes
- Use flexible layouts (CSS flexbox or Unity Canvas anchors) instead of fixed positions

ADVERTISEMENT PLACEMENT (POLICY SAFE & USER FRIENDLY):
- Banner Ads:
  - Place banner ads ONLY at the very bottom of the screen
  - Banner must be in a dedicated ad container
  - Ad container should never overlap game UI or buttons
- Gameplay Screen:
  - NO banner ads during active gameplay
- Main Menu & Game Over Screen:
  - Banner ad allowed at bottom with safe spacing
- Interstitial Ads:
  - Show only after every 2nd game over
  - Never show interstitial ads on app launch
- Rewarded Ads:
  - Trigger only when user clicks "Continue" button
  - After watching ad successfully, resume game safely

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- UI should automatically adjust for different mobile screen sizes
- Use relative units and anchors instead of absolute pixel values
- Ensure text, buttons, and ads scale properly on small and large phones

VISUAL FIXES:
- Keep background clean and uncluttered
- Ensure ads do not visually clash with game UI
- Maintain clear separation between game area and ad area

CODE & STRUCTURE:
- Separate AdContainer / AdManager logic
- Add comments explaining safe ad zones and spacing logic
- Ensure portrait mode and layout rules are enforced at code level

GOAL:
- The app must look and feel like a proper mobile portrait game
- Ads must never disturb gameplay or UI interaction
- Final result should be Play Store policy safe
